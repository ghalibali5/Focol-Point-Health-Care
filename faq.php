                <p><b>RAPID ANTIBODY TEST</b> – According to the
                    CDC, once someone has recovered from COVID-19,
                    they may have built an immunity to the virus;
                    making them less likely to contract it in the
                    future and spread it to others. The test itself
                    involves examining a small sample of someone’s
                    blood to detect proteins in the immune system
                    (known as antibodies). This test is approved
                    under EUA-Emergency Use Authorization by the
                    FDA.

                <p><b>PCR NASAL SWAB</b> PCR NASAL SWAB – This is
                    the gold standard test that checks individuals
                    for a current COVID-19 infection. The COVID-19
                    PCR Test is approved under EUA-Emergency Use
                    Authorization by the FDA. The results for this
                    test are required for travel, schools, work, and

                <h3>What does my insurance cover?
                </h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Most insurances will cover a PCR Nasal Swab every
                    14 days. Please contact your insurance provider
                    for more information. If you utilize your
                    insurance plan for a PCR Nasal Swab when your
                    previous test was less than 14 days ago, your
                    insurance may not cover your test. If your
                    insurance does not cover the PCR Nasal Swab
                    Test, we will send you a bill directly. There
                    may be a collection fee associated with your
                    test. Please call your nearest testing location
                for more details.</p>

                <h3>Am I immune to COVID-19 if my antibody test
                result is positive?
                </h3>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Having antibodies to the virus that causes
                    COVID-19 may provide protection from getting
                    infected with the virus again. But even if it
                    does, we do not know how much protection the
                    antibodies may provide or how long this
                    protection may last. Confirmed and suspected
                    cases of reinfection have been reported but
                    remain rare.
